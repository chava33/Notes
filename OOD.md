In object-oriented design, complexity is managed using abstraction.
    Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential
Classes are useful because they act as a blueprint for objects 

When we abstract just the interface of an operation and leave the implementation to subclasses it is called a polymorphic operation.
